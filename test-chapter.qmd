# Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model

The Black-Scholes model is a fundamental framework for pricing European options on non-dividend-paying stocks.

## Model Assumptions

The Black-Scholes model makes several key assumptions:

1. The stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant drift and volatility
2. The risk-free interest rate is constant and known
3. There are no dividends during the option's life
4. Markets are efficient (no transaction costs, taxes, or bid-ask spreads)
5. The option is European-style and can only be exercised at expiration

## The Black-Scholes Formula

For a European call option, the Black-Scholes formula is:

$$C = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)$$

where:

- $C$ = Call option price
- $S_0$ = Current stock price
- $K$ = Strike price
- $r$ = Risk-free interest rate
- $T$ = Time to expiration
- $N(x)$ = Cumulative standard normal distribution function

The parameters $d_1$ and $d_2$ are defined as:

$$d_1 = \frac{\ln(S_0/K) + (r + \sigma^2/2)T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}$$

$$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{T}$$

## Put-Call Parity

Put-call parity establishes a relationship between the prices of European put and call options:

$$C - P = S_0 - K e^{-rT}$$

This relationship ensures no arbitrage opportunities exist between puts, calls, the underlying stock, and risk-free bonds.

## Greeks and Risk Management

The Greeks measure the sensitivity of option prices to various factors:

### Delta
Delta ($\Delta$) measures the rate of change of the option price with respect to changes in the underlying asset's price:

$$\Delta_{call} = N(d_1)$$
$$\Delta_{put} = N(d_1) - 1$$

### Gamma
Gamma ($\Gamma$) measures the rate of change of delta with respect to changes in the underlying price:

$$\Gamma = \frac{n(d_1)}{S_0 \sigma \sqrt{T}}$$

where $n(x)$ is the standard normal probability density function.
